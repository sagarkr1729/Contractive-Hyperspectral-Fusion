# Contractive-Hyperspectral-Fusion
This repository contains the code for our paper **Hyperspectral Fusion**. 

## Description
In this paper, we show that the **Plug-and-Play** algorithms for **HS/MS fusion** are contractive for the linear self-adjoint class of denoisers. Specifically, the codes demonstrate:

- The contractive nature of **Plug-and-Play** algorithms for hyperspectral (HS) and multispectral (MS) fusion.
- The effectiveness of **CasKD Denoiser** in the **Plug-and-Play** framework.
- Fusion reconstruction using **PnP-PGD**.
- Calculation of the contraction factor for the our algorithmic setup.

These points highlight the key contributions of the paper.
